# Dsw-shoe-inventory-store-kotlin

In this project, i built an Android application with Kotlin!  I built a multi-screen Android app and create a navigation graph to take the user through the app. I used fundamental Android development skills to set up a development environment for an Android app, used Android Studioâ€™s Layout Editor, and implement best practices for navigation and user interface in Android. I also followed recommended Android app architecture guidance with ViewModel and LiveData lifecycle classes.
